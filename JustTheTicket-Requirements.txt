Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comments: [Philip Harle]

The tickets 001,003 and 010 has the same meaning to identify the owner,
and I choose the description of the requirement 001 as I prefere possibility of tracking from ticket to the owner.

REQ-ID: 002

REQ-ID: 008
Description: Allow the ticket(s) to be processed by the ticket reallocation programme.
Type: Functional
Rationale: The users require that a reallocate process be run once every 24 hours to consistently and manageably reallocate tickets.
Originator: Edna Everage

Requirements 006 and 020 are simillar to requirement 008 and the 008 is the most precise.

REQ-ID: 012
Description: The product shall list all returned tickets for rellocation 
Type: Functional
Rationale: to allow returned tickets to be reallocated every time the rellocation program is triggered
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Gabriel Ajabahian]

013 is non-function and no connection with business event ‘Customer returns one or more tickets’.

REQ-ID: 014
Description: The system should record the reason why each ticket was returned.
Type: Functional
Rationale: The organisers need to be able to understand the underlying reasons for ticket returns so that they can identify attempted fraud.
Originator:Edna Everage
Comments: [Pete Frost]

Tickets 005,007,009,011,014,018,025 are all duplicities, I personally decided to choose 014 as it seems to be most the most precise,
I also like 005 but for the business analyst with english as a second language is 014 just better.

REQ-ID: 015
Description: The system should differentiate returned tickets from available tickets.
Type: Functional
Rationale: The organisers wish to closely control the re-allocation of tickets; they do not want returned tickets to be immediately available to customers.
Originator:Edna Everage
Comments: [Pete Frost]

REQ-ID: 016
Description: The product shall allow one or more tickets to be returned
Type: Functional
Rationale: To enable customer to return ticket(s) they no longer need
Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comments: [Lauren key]

I believe that this is actually a very good point.

017 -Technology lock, assumption.

REQ-ID: 019
Description: The product must refund the customer�s money
Type: Functional
Rationale: To enable the purchase price of one more or tickets to be refunded when they are returned
Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comments: [David Howes]

021 half of the ticket is the same as 099, and as for 099 I am really not sure why ticket cannot be destroyed and printed again for the new customer in a place where he want to buy them.

REQ-ID: 022
Description: The product shall show the list of reasons why were tickets returned.
Type: Functional
Rationale: To understand the reasons for returns.
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Jiri Sedlacek]

I decided to prefer 022 to 030 as it is pure requirement without any assumption.

REQ-ID: 023
Description: The product shall show groups of returns grouped by parameters (place of return/date and time of return/number of returned tickets by customer/number of returned tickets by place/reason).
Type: Functional
Rationale: To detect any patterns that might be emerging to help protect the Games from fraud.
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Jiri Sedlacek]

This ticket is sometimes reffered as duplicate to 022, i do not think so as I believe that 022 is just to view reasons and 023 is to provide necessary data for pattern recognition.

REQ-ID: 024
Description: The product shall record the customer-type ticket pool that the returned ticket was originally sold from.
Type: Functional
Rationale: To ensure fair reallocation of the returned ticket.
Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comments: [Ben Kreft]

026 - Not connected with this business event.

027 - It is a fair requirement, but not connected with this business event.

028,029 - Technology lock, should be left on designer and no connection with business event ‘Customer returns one or more tickets’.

030 - This ticket is duplicate to 022, with technological lock (output can be left on designet) and we do not know what to report, so we do not have enough information to create a report.

REQ-ID: 031
Description: The product shall allow defining/adjusting of policy of reallocating tickets.
Type: Functional
Rationale: It is unknown at the moment how to manage such cases like "what should we do when two tickets are returned but the head of the queue wants three or more?"
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Remigiusz Duszynski]

098 - Makes sense, but no-one actualy said that this is a rule.
 
REQ-ID: 099
Description: The product shall release the returned ticket(s) into the reallocation inventory once the return is complete
Type: Functional
Rationale: To enable returned tickets to be available for the reallocation process run daily
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Baptiste Guittet-Carriere]

I am really not sure why ticket cannot be destroyed and printed again for the new customer in a place where he want to buy them.
