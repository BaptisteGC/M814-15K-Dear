Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comments: [Ben Kreft] NFR-008 relates to functional requirement REQ001
Comments: [Graham Gibbon] Linking the fit criterion to an external definition of a secure web would ensure it is explicit - for example NIST Special Publication 800-95 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-95/SP800-95.pdf) or something more appropriate.
