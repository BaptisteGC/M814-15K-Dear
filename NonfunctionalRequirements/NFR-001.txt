comments: [Lauren Key] Adding review response-I think this is a valid description.  My recommendations: Slightly lowering the percentage to say 80-85% would cater for people such as the older genteration and/or people with learning needs/disabilities who may struggle to use computers at a fast speed of 5-15 seconds without assisstence.  I feel your rational is good.
Comments: [Graham Gibbon] 90% in 5 seconds sounds reasonable (they could be selecting from a list) but the other 10% need more time say 90 seconds - they could choose to type in a custom reason for example.
