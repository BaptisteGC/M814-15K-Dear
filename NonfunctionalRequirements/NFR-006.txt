Comments: [Lauren Key] NFR-006 relates to Functional Requirement REQ-ID 017 and 019. 
Comments: [Andrew Kane] The description and rationale are good, but i think the wording of the fit criterion could be better, such as "The legel Department shall confirm the product conforms to...", as the current wording is ambiguous, how will the legel department safegaurd the product against breaches?  
Comments: [Jiri Sedlacek] This is more legal requirement than security requirement. Law does not have security standards.
Comments: [George Moschovitis] I agree with Jiri, the requirement looks more like legislation related than a security one.
