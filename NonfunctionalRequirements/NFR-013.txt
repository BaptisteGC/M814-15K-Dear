REQ-ID: NFR-013
Description: Implementation of two-factor authentication method to login.
Type: Security
Rationale: It is important to prevent non human activity for security and stability performance of the website and database. 
Fit Criterion: A text message(SMS) shall be send and received by the customer within 3 seconds.
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Ben Kreft] Agree with the rationale but the fit criterion implements a solution. I would suggest something along the lines of 'customer required to confirm/verify...'
Comments: [Graham Gibbon] Not in 100% agreement about the rationale - why the non-human activity part? Two-factor authentication can help with human authentication as well? Agree with Ben Kreft that the fit criterion is a solution currently. 
Comments: [Pete Frost] I'm not sure this is actually a non-functional requirement. It seems like a functional requirement to me as it specifies a behaviour.
