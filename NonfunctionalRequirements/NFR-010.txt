Comments: [David_Howes] NFR-010 relates to Functional Requirement REQ-ID 018.
Comments: [Matjaz Trcek] I do not see it as the most proper Usability case. Since it is about make it efficient for users, maybe a better way would be to have return field reason with a default value in case they don't choose another one.
Comments: [Remigiusz Duszynski] Is it reasonable to do it as easy and fast? Reasons for return are very important data. I think, to let users to take a whole minute to pecise the reason for returning is not too much expected.
