Comments: [David_Howes] NFR-010 relates to Functional Requirement REQ-ID 018.
[Matjaz Trcek] I do not see it as the most proper Usability case. Since it is about make it efficient for users, maybe a better way would be to have return field reason with a default value in case they don't choose another one.
