REQ-ID: NFR-004
Description: The product shall ensure all returned ticket(s) available for re-allocation are re-allocated to customers on the waiting list/re-sold.
Type: Performance
Rationale: There could be empty seats if tickets are not re-allocated/re-sold after they have been returned.
Fit Criterion: 95% of tickets must be re-allocated within 73 hours of been returned. Further 100% of returned tickets must be re-allocated within 121 hours of being returned. 
Originator: Edna Everage.
Comments: [GG] Req NFR-004 relates to functional requirement REQ-ID: 006.
[Philip Harle] The rationale is good, however free seats could be sold through the website not just the waiting list, so maybe change it to “resold” instead of “reallocated”. I’d suggest decreasing the fit criterion to around 95% to take account of instances where 1 ticket is returned but the customer waiting requires 2 or more.
Comments: [GG] Changed the rationale as per comments. Reworked the fit criterion in light of comments, allowing for multiple attempts to re-allocate.
Comments: [GG] Added criterion for last 5% of tickets. If there are no compatible entries on the waiting list, then the solution must cater for that eventuality.
