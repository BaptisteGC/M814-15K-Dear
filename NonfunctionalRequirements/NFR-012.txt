REQ-ID: 012
Description: The product shall keep detailed records of changes in the reallocation policy.
Type: NFR / Security / Audit
Rationale: Reallocation system decides who get the freed ticket, so employees could be tempted to manipulate the policy in order to give the tickets to their friends or family.
Fit Criterion: 100% of changes in the policy shall be detailed logged (who and when has changed the reallocation policy and what in detail was changed) in an inaccessible for employees depot.
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Remigiusz Duszynski] NFR-012 relates to Functional Requirement REQ-ID 031
[Matjaz Trcek] Good thinking, useful reviewing logs in case of a security breach. Could prevention of unauthorized personel or review process be more efficient? The problem I see with the NFR is that it could be possibly detected at a very late stage if not watched on
Comments: [Remigiusz Duszynski] Thanks Matjaz for your comment, I think I can handle them properly when I write an additional requirement (added below)

REQ-ID: 012-A
Description: The product shall proactively monitor changes in the reallocation policy.
Rationale: The problem with the NFR-012 is that it could be possibly detected at a very late stage if not watched on.
Fit Criterion: The product shall alert every change in the reallocation policy when it was not previously announced.
Originator: Matjaz Trcek
Comments: [Ben Kreft] 012-A's fit criterion appears to be a rewording of the description. I think you would have to acknowledge all changes to the reallocation policy as I'm unsure how a system could identify 'previously announced' changes.
